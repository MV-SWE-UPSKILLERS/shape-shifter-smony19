# ShapeShifter

Here is a library **chock full** of bugs. It is your job, intrepid programmer, to squash them.

## Getting started

Fork the repo and get it on your machine.

Do an `npm install`.

Now run `npm run test:easy` and behold the litany of errors.

Take a look in `challenges > easy` and try to fix some code. Run `npm run test:easy` again to see if it works!

Keep going until you have fixed the `easy` bugs.

## Moving on

The challenges in `medium` and `hard` will require you to look things up (some links are included to help). You can `npm run test:medium` and `npm run test:hard` to check your progress.
